# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## OVERVIEW
###
The point of this project was to mount a plan of action given the understanding that a large portion of the current workforce is aging into retirement.
## RESULTS
### Deliverables Analysis
1. There is an enormous number of oncoming retirees (90,000+) in comparison to the total number of Pewlett-Hackard employees, especially in functional roles like Staff or Engineer.
2. The number of employees in the Mentorship Eligible category is much, much smaller at nearly 2,000.
3. The composition of people nearing retirement age has much less of a focus in the managerial sector of employment, so the hiring and training emphasis should be elsewhere.
4. The number of younger employees that will have to be more widely distributed across the different tiers of this corporate hierarchy means that outside hiring might be a more attractive route for upper management to pursue.
## SUMMARY
### Given Query 1: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
-Upward of 90,000 roles are going to need to be filled. These will likely not all be at once but more progressive as some individuals won't want to retire immediately upon hitting the eligible age. However, upper management needs to know that even those dedicated in such a manner are just a ticking clock.
### Given Query 2: Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?
-There are plenty of qualified, retirement-ready employees in all departments especially in function roles like Staff or Engineer. The real question is whether or not enough employees will be left to fill the different strata within the company's tiered structure once these retirement-ready folks are gone.
### Additional Query 1
-A very likely query to ask would be to examine the number of upcoming retirees by department. The people in positions to mentor will often times be best equipped to do so if they have the departmental knowledge, as well as the necessary title.
### Additional Query 2
-One of the other view to examine would be Title count for employees in various age groups. This would educate upper management on what people in their employ are likely to form the crop from which the next Senior level positions are harvested. Take into account the average length of employ for each of the people in this analysis.
